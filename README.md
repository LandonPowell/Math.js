# Math.js
An extension for JavaScript's Math object. Includes Average, MAD, and more! I lazily wrote this so I could automate my online work during 11th grade. I'll probably add more to this as I need it.

### Functions - 

`Math.avg` - Input: List of numbers. Output: Average.

`Math.mad` - Input: List of numbers. Output: Mean Absolute Deviation

`Math.range` - Input: Min, Max, [Optional Step]. Output: List of numbers from one value to the other.

`Math.randomChoice` - Input: List. Output: Pseudorandom element from that list.
